    in various cities around the world. I am world traveler as well as a culinary enthusiast, so i figured
    why don't I make a website that displays my research . I have put a lot of time into this and I hope anytime
    you travel to a new city you think of Steaksta for the food recommendations and eventually I will build it 
    to where you may upload a list that will be revised by me and I will add valid recommendations .">
